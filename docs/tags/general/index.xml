I came in second, and for that I was awarded a custom app token from Matic. It finally came last week and here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I finally have a sign for my office.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>App: The Human Story - My Story</title><link>https://rodschmidt.com/posts/app-the-human-story-my-story/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2014 22:47:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rodschmidt.com/posts/app-the-human-story-my-story/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There is a Kickstarter project that was started recently for a film titled &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/appdocu/app-the-human-story"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App: The Human Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It &amp;ldquo;is the story of the cultural phenomenon that touches all our lives.&amp;rdquo; It is about the people who make apps. Many of them are people I follow on blogs, and listen to on podcasts, and look up to. I simply had to back the project, and I did. The producers of the film, on their blog, have asked that others involved in apps write about their own stories. This is my story.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A New Start</title><link>https://rodschmidt.com/posts/a-new-start/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2014 22:44:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rodschmidt.com/posts/a-new-start/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed, my weblog has a new design and new content. I have switched from WordPress to Octopress and have used a new theme. So far, I like it. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to use Markdown instead of some slow web tool to write my posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old blog was mostly political commentary and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to remove that. Some of my most popular posts were the posts about my sabbatical that I took in the summer of 2002. Those, I have preserved and ported over to the new system. I enjoyed reading them myself. You can find them in the &lt;a href="https://rodschmidt.com/tags/sabbatical/"&gt;Sabbatical&lt;/a&gt; category.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
