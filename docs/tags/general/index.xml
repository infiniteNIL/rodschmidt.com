      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/app-the-human-story-my-story/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and entered it in a contest for &lt;a href=&#34;http://appdocumentary.com/app-stories/submitted&#34;&gt;App: The Human Story&lt;/a&gt;. I came in second, and for that I was awarded a custom app token from Matic. It finally came last week and here it is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img style=&#34;display: block; margin: 0.7rem auto; border: 1px solid black; margin-bottom: 0px;&#34; &#xA;       src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/apptoken-300x300.jpg&#34; &#xA;       title=&#34;My app token&#34; &#xA;       alt=&#34;My app token&#34;&#xA;       &#xA;  &gt;&#xA;  &lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-size: smaller;&#34;&gt;My app token&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I finally have a sign for my office.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a Kickstarter project that was started recently for a film titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/appdocu/app-the-human-story&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App: The Human Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It &amp;ldquo;is the story of the cultural phenomenon that touches all our lives.&amp;rdquo; It is about the people who make apps. Many of them are people I follow on blogs, and listen to on podcasts, and look up to. I simply had to back the project, and I did. The producers of the film, on their blog, have asked that others involved in apps write about their own stories. This is my story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A New Start</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed, my weblog has a new design and new content. I have switched from WordPress to Octopress and have used a new theme. So far, I like it. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to use Markdown instead of some slow web tool to write my posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My old blog was mostly political commentary and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to remove that. Some of my most popular posts were the posts about my sabbatical that I took in the summer of 2002. Those, I have preserved and ported over to the new system. I enjoyed reading them myself. You can find them in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/tags/sabbatical/&#34;&gt;Sabbatical&lt;/a&gt; category.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
