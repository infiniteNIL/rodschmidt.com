      <description>Believe or not, I just got around to watching the 2 Steve Jobs movies that came out a few years ago: Steve Jobs, starring Michael Fassbender, and Jobs, staring Ashton Kutcher
I’ve held off watching them because I knew there would be a lot of inaccuracies. I grew up with Steve Jobs. I followed him. I didn’t want to see him distorted the way Hollywood does.
I actually liked Jobs. Kutcher actually looks like Steve Jobs and he went to the effort to capture some of his mannerisms and speech patterns.</description>
