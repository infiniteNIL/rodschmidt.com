      <description>&lt;p&gt;In comments to my last article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/composable-architecture-experience&#34;&gt;The Composable Architecture&lt;/a&gt; readers have asked about examples of how I think an app should be written. In the article, I did mention my previous posts, which have examples for Clean Swift and MVVM, but those were written for UIKit. SwiftUI didn’t exist at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, this article will talk about what I think is a great example of architecture for a SwiftUI app. Pointfree’s own &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pointfreeco/syncups&#34;&gt;SyncUps&lt;/a&gt; app. The example actually has 2 apps, one showing tree-based navigation, and one showing stack-based navigation. For this article, I will just focus on the stack-based example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Composable Architecture: My 3 Year Experience</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently finished a 3 year stint with a company that uses the Composable Architecture (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture&#34;&gt;TCA&lt;/a&gt;)&#xA;from &lt;a href=&#34;https://pointfree.co&#34;&gt;PointFree&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to write about my experiences with TCA and some of&#xA;the problems I see with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think Brandon Williams and Stephen Cellis, the creators of TCA, are absolutely brilliant, and what&#xA;they have managed to pull off with the creation of TCA is amazing. However, It’s just the two of them,&#xA;and nobody, or no thing, is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Swift UI &amp; App Architecture: A New Approach Required</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With SwiftUI, everything has changed. As Brent Simmons said, it’s the end of the NeXT era and the beginning of the Swift era.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the coming of SwiftUI, most of our app architectures are no longer valid (or at least parts of them). They need to be adjusted. MVC is certainly out. In fact, even controllers seem to be out. From Apple’s content, it seems all we have is models and views, and that’s true. Bindings have seemingly replaced controllers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
