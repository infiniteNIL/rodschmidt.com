      <title>Numerology: 17 Years in the App Store (Part 6)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part 6 of my blog series on the history of my app Numerology. See Part 5 &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/numerology-history-5&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we left off, Numerology was chugging along, slowly making less and less each month. First $300, then $200, sometimes as low as $100. Sometimes it would spurt back up to $300.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This continued until fairly recently. In 2024, I noticed a competitor that always showed up first in the App Store search results when you searched for ‘numerology’. I decided to look into them a little more. According to Sensor Tower, their app was making over $5,000/month on the Apple App Store. They had an Android app as well, and it was making $5,000/month as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part 5 of my blog series on the history of my app Numerology. See Part 4 &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/numerology-history-4&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was probably the first numerology app on the App Store. If you searched for numerology, my app would be first in the results.  At some point this was no longer true. A competitor came out and my sales started to go down. Today, in 2025, there are possibly over a 100 numerology apps on the store.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Everyone else did the same and Apple was swamped. Despite applying as soon as possible, I didn’t get approved for about 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All the great APIs from NeXTStep (hence the NS prefixes to all the class names and such) together were called Cocoa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I finally had my chance to use the wonderful platform I’d been wanting to use for almost a decade. My full-time job was still with Java and enterprise world and it was increasingly not fun. I spent my off-time learning Cocoa. My first app was not Numerology though. It was an app called PhoneWord that found all the words you could make from a phone number. For example, from the phone number 555-5299 you could get 555-JAZZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Steve Jobs was at NeXT. I had some model of Macintosh II running on a 680x0 processor. I also had a compiler for C with object-oriented extensions (basically a subset of C++), called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THINK_C&#34;&gt;THINK C&lt;/a&gt;, with a class library called TCL, or the Think Class Library.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id292749698&#34;&gt;Numerology&lt;/a&gt;, has been in the Apple app store for over 17 years. During that time, it and its variations (lite version, Mac version) have been downloaded over 188,000 times, and made almost $150,000 in profit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img style=&#34;display: block; margin: 0.7rem auto; border: 1px solid black; margin-bottom: 0px;&#34; &#xA;       src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/numerology-logo.png&#34; &#xA;       title=&#34;Numerology Icon&#34; &#xA;       alt=&#34;Numerology Icon&#34;&#xA;       &#xA;       width=&#34;128&#34;&#xA;       &#xA;  &gt;&#xA;  &lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-size: smaller;&#34;&gt;Numerology Icon&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s ran on just about every Apple iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Before the App Store, it even ran on classic macOS machines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pointfree&#39;s SyncUps App: A Great Example Architecture for a SwiftUI App</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In comments to my last article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/composable-architecture-experience&#34;&gt;The Composable Architecture&lt;/a&gt; readers have asked about examples of how I think an app should be written. In the article, I did mention my previous posts, which have examples for Clean Swift and MVVM, but those were written for UIKit. SwiftUI didn’t exist at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, this article will talk about what I think is a great example of architecture for a SwiftUI app. Pointfree’s own &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pointfreeco/syncups&#34;&gt;SyncUps&lt;/a&gt; app. The example actually has 2 apps, one showing tree-based navigation, and one showing stack-based navigation. For this article, I will just focus on the stack-based example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently finished a 3 year stint with a company that uses the Composable Architecture (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture&#34;&gt;TCA&lt;/a&gt;)&#xA;from &lt;a href=&#34;https://pointfree.co&#34;&gt;PointFree&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to write about my experiences with TCA and some of&#xA;the problems I see with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think Brandon Williams and Stephen Cellis, the creators of TCA, are absolutely brilliant, and what&#xA;they have managed to pull off with the creation of TCA is amazing. However, It’s just the two of them,&#xA;and nobody, or no thing, is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Swift UI &amp; App Architecture: A New Approach Required</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With SwiftUI, everything has changed. As Brent Simmons said, it’s the end of the NeXT era and the beginning of the Swift era.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the coming of SwiftUI, most of our app architectures are no longer valid (or at least parts of them). They need to be adjusted. MVC is certainly out. In fact, even controllers seem to be out. From Apple’s content, it seems all we have is models and views, and that’s true. Bindings have seemingly replaced controllers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Clean Architecture: An Example</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I’d like to take an example iOS app written with an MVC architecture and show you what the example would be with a Clean Swift architecture. The example I’ve chosen to use is the Quiz app from chapter 1 of the 3rd edition of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321821521/ref=sr_1_7?crid=393OBE770KCSR&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=big+nerd+ranch+ios+programming&amp;amp;qid=1586836438&amp;amp;sprefix=Big+nerd+ranch%2Caps%2C182&amp;amp;sr=8-7&#34;&gt;iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Quiz is a simple app that is like flash cards. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img style=&#34;display: block; margin: 0.7rem auto; border: 1px solid black; margin-bottom: 0px;&#34; &#xA;       src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/quiz.png&#34; &#xA;       title=&#34;&#34; &#xA;       alt=&#34;&#34;&#xA;       &#xA;  &gt;&#xA;  &lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-size: smaller;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Model View Controller: Problems and Solutions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model View Controller&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;MVC&lt;/em&gt; is the application architecture used by default for applications on all Apple platforms. Most of the tools, frameworks, and docs from Apple all talk about it and support it. In MVC, objects are assigned 1 of 3 roles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model&lt;/strong&gt; - objects that encapsulate and manage the data the application works with (this includes persistence). The data typically represents things in the real world like an employee, hardware part, or a picture that is being drawn. More abstract things can also be part of a model such as a hiring process. When data in the model changes it notifies a controller object, typically via delegation or notifications. Model objects should have no knowledge of the user interface and be reusable in other applications in similar problem domains or on other devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/what-are-the-downsides-to-putting-the-core-data-moc-in-the-app-delegate-part-2/#more-243&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about why putting the MOC in the app delegate is a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/what-are-the-downsides-to-putting-the-core-data-moc-in-the-app-delegate/&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about why putting the MOC in your app delegate makes you dependent on Core Data for your application’s persistence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I like to talk about the 3rd reason I gave in part 1, which is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any code you write that uses &lt;code&gt;myManagedObjectContext&lt;/code&gt; will be dependent on the App Delegate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any code you write in another source file, say a subclass of &lt;code&gt;UITableViewController&lt;/code&gt; for example, that uses &lt;code&gt;myManagedObjectContext&lt;/code&gt; from the app delegate will be dependent on the app delegate. In Objective-C this would mean you would need a &lt;code&gt;#import &amp;quot;AppDelegate.h&lt;/code&gt; statement in your subclass’ source file. Every source file that accesses the app delegate’s MOC would need that import, which would bring in everything else the app delegate uses. In Swift, you don’t need the import statement, but it would increase your compile times, as it would in Objective-C as well. Every time you made a change to the app delegate, any source files that accessed the MOC in the app delegate would have to be recompiled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/what-are-the-downsides-to-putting-the-core-data-moc-in-the-app-delegate/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I gave some reasons why putting the Core Data MOC in your app delegate was a bad idea. Those reasons were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The app delegate is managing the Core Data stack. Classes should only have one responsibility. The app delegate is already responsible for managing application lifecycle. It shouldn’t be managing the Core Data stack as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You are completely dependent on Core Data and using it as your persistence method for your app. What if you decide to switch to Realm or something?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any code you write that uses &lt;code&gt;myManagedObjectContext&lt;/code&gt; will be dependent on the App Delegate.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any tests you write will be dependent on the App Delegate and Core Data and will be hard to test and slow as a result.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/what-are-the-downsides-to-putting-the-core-data-moc-in-the-app-delegate/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, we talked about how putting the Core Data MOC in your app delegate makes your app dependent on Core Data as your persistence mechanism and makes it hard to use something else. In this post, I’d like to talk about &lt;strong&gt;reason #1: That your app delegate is already responsible for managing the application life cycle and it shouldn’t be responsible for the Core Data stack as well&lt;/strong&gt;. This comes from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)&#34;&gt;SOLID&lt;/a&gt; principles of good object-oriented design, specifically the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle&#34;&gt;Single Responsibility Principle&lt;/a&gt;, which states:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3 Ways To Fix Your iOS Testing Woes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of companies have constant problems testing their iOS apps. Here are some ways to fix or ease them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-dont-make-developers-run-or-write-ui-tests&#34;&gt;1. Don’t Make Developers Run or Write UI Tests&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UI tests are black box tests and test the app from the perspective of the user. Your developers are the worst choice to test the app from this viewpoint and you need a fresh set of eyes for those tests. The QA engineer’s job is to test the app from the user’s viewpoint. Your QA Engineers should write these tests. Plus, UI tests run entirely too slow for your developers to run them all the time and are much too failure prone. Don’t waste their time by making them write and run these tests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw this question on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming&#34;&gt;iOSProgramming&lt;/a&gt; topic in reddit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a number of different ways to access the NSManagedObjectContext when working with Core Data, but I was wondering if there are any downsides to the way I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it. Basically, I stick a computed variable in the AppDelegate, and grab it when I need it&amp;hellip; Please let me know if you see any flaws&amp;hellip; If not, feel free to use it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
