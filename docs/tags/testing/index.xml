When I first started my career, I didn’t hear about writing tests until a few years in. Then we started writing tests for all our libraries. When I first got into Cocoa development, testing was not a part of the culture. That slowly changed, and now it is an important part of development on Apple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways we are still catching up to other development cultures where testing has been much more ingrained in the culture, such as the web development world. Their tools just seem to be more mature, but it is also easier to test something that is based on a stateless protocol like HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Clean Architecture: An Introduction</title><link>https://rodschmidt.com/posts/the-clean-architecture-an-introduction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2016 00:33:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rodschmidt.com/posts/the-clean-architecture-an-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last &lt;a href="https://rodschmidt.com/posts/moving-towards-the-clean-architecture-for-apple-development/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about various architectures used as alternatives to MVC, in a attempt to solve MVCs problems, such as Massive View Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I would like to introduce you to another architecture, which seems to me to be the best starting point for your app’s architecture: the Clean Architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I first ran into the Clean Architecture in one of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkDN78P884"&gt;Uncle Bob’s presentations on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. At first, I kind of wrote it off as a typical Java over-engineered design pattern. It wasn’t until earlier this year, probably years later after my initial discovery, that I ran into it again. I was looking for a better app architecture after an experience working for a large company with a large iOS team (with about 11 developers) and all the issues they had getting the app to work and test it. I kind of became obsessed with figuring out how to make an app easier to test. I searched the internet for app architectures and studied them. It took me awhile to get my head around the Clean Architecture, but once I did, I decided it would be my starting point for an app architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Part 4: What Are the Downsides to Putting the Core Data MOC in the App Delegate</title><link>https://rodschmidt.com/posts/part-4-what-are-the-downsides-to-putting-the-core-data-moc-in-the-app-delegate/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2016 21:49:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rodschmidt.com/posts/part-4-what-are-the-downsides-to-putting-the-core-data-moc-in-the-app-delegate/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://rodschmidt.com/posts/part-3-what-are-the-downsides-to-putting-the-core-data-moc-in-the-app-delegate/"&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about why putting the MOC in the app delegate makes any code that uses the MOC will be dependent on the app delegate and why that’s not a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://rodschmidt.com/posts/what-are-the-downsides-to-putting-the-core-data-moc-in-the-app-delegate-part-2/#more-243"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about why putting the MOC in the app delegate is a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are some ways to fix or ease them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="1-dont-make-developers-run-or-write-ui-tests"&gt;1. Don’t Make Developers Run or Write UI Tests&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UI tests are black box tests and test the app from the perspective of the user. Your developers are the worst choice to test the app from this viewpoint and you need a fresh set of eyes for those tests. The QA engineer’s job is to test the app from the user’s viewpoint. Your QA Engineers should write these tests. Plus, UI tests run entirely too slow for your developers to run them all the time and are much too failure prone. Don’t waste their time by making them write and run these tests.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
