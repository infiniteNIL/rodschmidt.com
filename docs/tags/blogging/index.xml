      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed that my blog has changed again. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved back to Wordpress from Octopress. I could never find a plugin for Octopress that did image captions right. I spent way too much time on it and just decided to use something that just worked. I looked at a lot of static blogging engines and they all had their issues.
With Wordpress, I have to use the web based editor, but it works and their is a lot of plugins and support behind it.</description>
