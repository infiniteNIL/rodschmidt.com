      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve visited this site in the past, you’ve probably noticed a change. I recently changed my blogging platform from WordPress to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.com&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. Hugo is static site generator. I also changed my theme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was never really satisfied with the performance of my WordPress site. Combine that with the fact that my site kept going down every month, I decided that it was time to do something and be more in control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Back to Wordpress</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed that my blog has changed again. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved back to Wordpress from Octopress. I could never find a plugin for Octopress that did image captions right. I spent way too much time on it and just decided to use something that just worked. I looked at a lot of static blogging engines and they all had their issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Wordpress, I have to use the web based editor, but it works and their is a lot of plugins and support behind it. I have better things to spend my time on. To make things better, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll try &lt;a href=&#34;http://desk.pm&#34;&gt;Desk&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve also installed the Markdown plugin, so I can continue to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
