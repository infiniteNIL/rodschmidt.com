      <description>If you’ve visited this site in the past, you’ve probably noticed a change. I recently changed my blogging platform from WordPress to Hugo. Hugo is static site generator. I also changed my theme.
Why? I was never really satisfied with the performance of my WordPress site. Combine that with the fact that my site kept going down every month, I decided that it was time to do something and be more in control.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed that my blog has changed again. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved back to Wordpress from Octopress. I could never find a plugin for Octopress that did image captions right. I spent way too much time on it and just decided to use something that just worked. I looked at a lot of static blogging engines and they all had their issues.
With Wordpress, I have to use the web based editor, but it works and their is a lot of plugins and support behind it.</description>
