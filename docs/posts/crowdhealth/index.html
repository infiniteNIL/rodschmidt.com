The least expensive plan on the marketplace for me is over $700. That would make it the 2nd highest item on my monthly expense list. Right now, my monthly income is less than that. I simply can’t afford it.</p><h2 id=solution>Solution</h2><p>I’m pretty healthy, and I’m into alternative healthcare such as functional medicine. I don’t believe in covering up symptoms with drugs.</p><p>Conventional health insurance rarely covers what I believe is the best way to address my health issues.</p><p>I went to healthcare.gov and started an application. Multiple times. Each time, they would say the state of Utah would need to look at my application to see if I qualify for medicare. The state would come back and say I didn&rsquo;t qualify, but I still couldn&rsquo;t get through to see the plans. I had to lie on my application to get to the plans.</p><p>As I said above, the cheapest plan was over $700 a month. I didn&rsquo;t want to play that.</p><p><a href="https://www.joincrowdhealth.com/?referral_code=A3VIIQ">CrowdHealth</a> is the solution I found. It’s crowd sharing for health expenses. You pay a monthly membership of $55. On top of that, you will be asked to contribute to someone else’s needs each month. My first month, I was asked for $40, but it could be a few hundred. The max you would pay in one month is around $350. This is cheaper than the COBRA continuation plan I was using.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.joincrowdhealth.com/?referral_code=A3VIIQ">CrowdHealth</a> for more information and to see if it will work for you.</p><p>If it does, then please click the links above, or this <a href="https://www.joincrowdhealth.com/?referral_code=A3VIIQ">link</a> to signup. I get $250 for each signup.</p><p>Good luck to you.</p></div><script async data-uid=d20275c87b src=https://rodschmidt.kit.com/d20275c87b/index.js></script><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/numerology-history-1/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
