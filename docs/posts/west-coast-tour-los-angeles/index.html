After spending the night in Palo Alto, I started down the freeway to LA the next morning. Nothing really to write about here. Just your standard freeway drive. However, the traffic was horrible. Seemed like every half-hour or so you ran into stop and go traffic. Not fun. Just this alone made me think I didn&rsquo;t want to live here.
My friend, Laury&rsquo;s sister and brother-in-law live in LA."/>

<p>After spending the night in Palo Alto, I started down the freeway to LA the next morning. Nothing really to write about here. Just your standard freeway drive. However, the traffic was horrible. Seemed like every half-hour or so you ran into stop and go traffic. Not fun. Just this alone made me think I didn&rsquo;t want to live here.</p>
<p>My friend, Laury&rsquo;s sister and brother-in-law live in LA. Laury let them know I was coming so I called them and got directions to their place. Arrived about 5pm. Ron and Roe were very nice and gracious to let me stay in their place. I convinced Ron to come to game with me (Yea, I didn&rsquo;t have to drive) and we headed off to the Dodger game.</p>
<p>Dodger Stadium was the first stadium and baseball game I ever went to. I was about 7 years old. I hadn&rsquo;t been there since despite the fact that the Dodgers were and are my favorite team. It was great the see the beautiful stadium overlooking the palm trees.</p>
<p>The game was fun too. The Dodgers played the Anaheim Angels. My first freeway series! The Dodgers jumped to an early lead with back-to-back home runs. A couple of innings later, Shawn Green hit his second homer of the night. A week earlier he had hit 4 home runs in one game. Unfortunately, that didn&rsquo;t happen again. He was intentionally walked and flied out his other times at bat. In the end it was the Dodgers 10-5.</p>
<p>P.S. Stay tuned for pictures. I had to get them developed because I forgot my camera at the game.</p>
