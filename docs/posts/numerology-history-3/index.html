All the great APIs from NeXTStep (hence the NS prefixes to all the class names and such) together were called Cocoa.</p><p>Now I finally had my chance to use the wonderful platform I’d been wanting to use for almost a decade. My full-time job was still with Java and enterprise world and it was increasingly not fun. I spent my off-time learning Cocoa. My first app was not Numerology though. It was an app called PhoneWord that found all the words you could make from a phone number. For example, from the phone number 555-5299 you could get 555-JAZZ.</p><div><img style="display:block;margin:.7rem auto;border:1px solid #000;margin-bottom:0" src=https://rodschmidt.com/images/phonewordscreenshot.png title=PhoneWord alt=PhoneWord width=512><p style=text-align:center;font-size:smaller>PhoneWord</p></div><p>I wrote other apps as well, and tried to sell them on my website, but none did very well.</p><h2 id=becoming-a-mac-os-x-developer>Becoming a Mac OS X Developer</h2><p>My Java job was so boring that I would have not much to do for hours. I worked for a large corporation as a contractor. Even to do a build, you would have to get permission from headquarters, so we had lots of time on our hands. I would spend a lot of the time working on Cocoa apps and learning Cocoa.</p><p>In 2003, I found a small company in Park City that wrote Mac software. I contacted them and they hired me as a contractor to help work on their software. I quit my Java job and started working as a Cocoa developer.</p><h2 id=the-birth-of-the-iphone>The Birth of the iPhone</h2><p>Let ’s jump ahead a little to 2007. I’m still working as a Mac developer and as a contractor. In January at MacWorld, Steve Jobs announced the iPhone. I was super excited. I knew then that this was the future and like all developers, I wanted to write apps for it. Super disappointed at Apple’s initial statement about just writing web apps for it. I think all developers knew that it was just a matter of time before we could write apps for it and those apps would most likely be using the Cocoa frameworks.</p><p>In March of 2008, the iPhone SDK was released. The main framework for the user interface was called UIKIt and was heavily based on Cocoa&rsquo;s AppKit but tailored for phones and small screens. In fact, the whole group of frameworks for creating iPhone apps was called Cocoa Touch. Everyone wanted to create apps for it.</p><p>The App Store opened on July 10th, 2008.</p><h2 id=transitioning-to-an-ios-developer>Transitioning to an iOS Developer</h2><p>Around this time, the world was in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis. I was laid off from my job doing Mac OS development. Not many companies were hiring and it was hard to find a job.</p><p>However, lots of people wanted to write iPhone apps. I started freelancing and finding contracts to write apps and of course I applied for my Apple Developer account so I could sell my apps on the App Store.</p><p>Stay tuned for part 4, where I’ll talk about the beginning of Numerology on the App Store.</p></div><script async data-uid=d20275c87b src=https://rodschmidt.kit.com/d20275c87b/index.js></script><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/numerology-history-2/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
