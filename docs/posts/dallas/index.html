    <p><strong>August 8th - August 14th, 2002</strong></p>
<p>Thurday morning I drove up to Dallas. It took about 4 hours and I checked into another extended stay motel. Originally, I had planned to stay in Dallas for a week, just like in Austin, but my Austin experience changed my plans. I was going to leave on the 14th, after the baseball game.</p>
<p>Again, the idea was the same. To just be there and experience Dallas. However, there were a few things I wanted to do. There&rsquo;s an Apple Store in Plano, a town just north of Dallas. Apple has been opening stores all over the country, but none yet in Utah, so I had to go check it out. Also, I wanted to check out downtown and see some JFK stuff, and of course the Texas Rangers are in nearby Arlington.</p>

<p>Also, I have an old high school friend who now lives in Dallas. Marc moved to Georgia after he graduated from college and then to Dallas, where he works for Texas Instruments. I got in touch with him and had lunch with him on Friday. It didn&rsquo;t take long for us to get back in the swing. It didn&rsquo;t feel like we had been apart much at all. He took me to see TI&rsquo;s digital projector demos where we watched the <em>Star Wars: Episode II</em> trailer on a big movie size HDTV screen with a digital projector. He invited me to his place on Sunday for dinner, where I met his family and ate a delicious meal. Marc and his wife, Christy, have 4 kids. 3 girls and 1 boy. The oldest is 9, so they have their hands full. It was nice to see everybody and to see how things are going.</p>
