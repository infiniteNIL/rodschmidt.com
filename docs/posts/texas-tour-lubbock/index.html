<meta name="twitter:description" content="Saturday, August 3rd
From Albuquerque, I decided to go half way to Austin, and stay the night with a recent friend of the family and her family. I had just met her when I had been up to Montana this summer and she had offered to let me stay with her and her family when I went to Texas. In the directions she gave me to get to her house she mentioned that there was a steel house that I couldn&rsquo;t miss."/>

    <p><strong>Saturday, August 3rd</strong></p>
<p>From Albuquerque, I decided to go half way to Austin, and stay the night with a recent friend of the family and her family. I had just met her when I had been up to Montana this summer and she had offered to let me stay with her and her family when I went to Texas. In the directions she gave me to get to her house she mentioned that there was a steel house that I couldn&rsquo;t miss. She was right. However, she didn&rsquo;t mention that it was their house that her husband had been building for 27 years!</p>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: smaller;">The Steel House</p>
</div>


<p>It is probably the most interesting house I have ever seen. From some angles it looks like a spaceship. From the outside it looks like the villian&rsquo;s submersible fortess in the <em>Spy Who Loved Me</em>. Inside, it has flowing stairs, curved walls and big windows. A very cool house.</p>

<p>For dinner we went to an Italian restaurant, very similar to Macaroni Grill. After dinner, we saw a video. It was <em>The Sheltering Sky</em> with John Malkovich and Debra Winger. By the time that was over, it was 2 in the morning. And then we went for a walk!</p>
<p>I had planned to leave right away in the morning, but I was having a lot of fun and Patricia was pretty persuasive. Once I woke up, we went for another walk. I ended leaving for Austin about 11 am. All in all it was a lot of fun and Patricia and her husband, Robert are an interesting couple and easy to get along with. Patrica is very outgoing and Robert and I seem to have a similiar philosophy about life and our respective crafts (he&rsquo;s an architect).</p>
