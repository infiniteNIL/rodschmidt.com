(thanks to my sister&rsquo;s buddy pass) and arrived at about 2:30 PM EST. Caught
the MARTA (Atlanta equivalent of TRAX) right from the airport to downtown.
My hotel was only a couple of blocks from my stop. One thing I notice is the
humidity. To me, it actually felt good. Keeps your skin moist and when it&rsquo;s
hot you actually sweat. Just the way it should be.</p><p>A couple of hours later I walked back to the MARTA and took a short trip
(Just one stop north) and walked through Underground Atlanta. Not much of a
big deal, just an underground mall basically. But it lead right to the Braves
shuttle, which is a bus that takes you right to the game. I arrived at Turner
Field at about maybe 5:30 or 5:45 PM. Other people are there also. I spend the
time before the game touring the stadium, taking in the Braves museum and trying
to decide what I want to eat.</p><div><img style="display:block;margin:.7rem auto;border:1px solid #000;margin-bottom:0" src=https://rodschmidt.com/images/Front_Gate-300x225.jpg title="Turner Field" alt="Turner Field"><p style=text-align:center;font-size:smaller>Turner Field</p></div><p>I found my seat, then got 3 tacos, making sure I got soda with the souvenir
cup that I use to record my stadium visits. Soon after I finish eating the
game starts and guess what! The starting pitcher is Greg Maddux! For those
of you who don&rsquo;t know, he&rsquo;s probably, currently, the best pitcher in
baseball. The Braves are playing the Mets, so I will also get to see Mike
Piazza. Another star player, who should still be playing for the Dodgers :)</p><div><img style="display:block;margin:.7rem auto;border:1px solid #000;margin-bottom:0" src=https://rodschmidt.com/images/Mike_Piazza.jpg title="Mike Piazza" alt="Mike Piazza"><p style=text-align:center;font-size:smaller>Mike Piazza</p></div><p>It was a good game with leads being exchanged but both teams staying close.
You could tell that the Atlanta fans really love their Braves. Always
cheering and trying to get them back in the game and booing the umps when
they make a bad (which they made 2). In the end the Braves came on top with
a game winning triple to win the game 6-4. Jon Smoltz (another great pitcher)
came in in the bottom of the 9th and sealed the victory.</p><p>The next morning I had to get up early (3am MST) to catch an early flight,
which of course was full. I eventually ended up going to Denver and then to
Salt Lake, arriving home at about 2:30 PM. And finally, on the flight from
Denver to SLC, I got to sit next to an interesting women. A young, sharply
dressed brunette. As soon as she said, &ldquo;It looks like I&rsquo;m sitting between
you all&rdquo;, I had a good hunch she was from Texas. She slept through most the
flight, but I finally got to talk to her as we were landing. And yep, she
was from Dallas. Coincidence? We shall see.</p><p>I had been to Atlanta once before when I stayed the night on my way to
Florida for my summer internship with IBM in Boca Raton. Then I really
didn&rsquo;t care for it. This trip was much better. The people were friendly and
I was more open-minded. Atlanta made me realize what a real city was like. It
had a lot more energy than Salt Lake.</p><p>Next up, my west coast tour.</p></div><script async data-uid=d20275c87b src=https://relentless-teacher-3937.ck.page/d20275c87b/index.js></script><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/west-coast-tour-portland/ class=navigation-next><span class=navigation-tittle>West Coast Tour - Portland</span>
