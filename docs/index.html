The First App Store Version In 2008, Apple announced the App Store and I applied for an Apple Developer membership ($99/year), so I could sell apps on the App Store. Everyone else did the same and Apple was swamped. Despite applying as soon as possible, I didn’t get approved for about 6 months.</span>

The Birth of Cocoa In 2001, Apple released the first version of Mac OS X 10.0, the first desktop version of their new OS based on NEXTStep. All the great APIs from NeXTStep (hence the NS prefixes to all the class names and such) together were called Cocoa.
Now I finally had my chance to use the wonderful platform I’d been wanting to use for almost a decade.</span>

The First Version It was the very early 90’s. Steve Jobs was at NeXT. I had some model of Macintosh II running on a 680x0 processor. I also had a compiler for C with object-oriented extensions (basically a subset of C++), called THINK C, with a class library called TCL, or the Think Class Library.</span>

<span class=item__date>Oct 29, 2025</span>
<span>Problem Are you self-employed? Are you unemployed? Do you have to purchase your own health insurance?
Are you generally healthy, and rarely need a doctor? Are you into alternative health care, which health insurance never covers anyway?
Do you find “Affordable” health care, unaffordable like you see on healthcare.gov?
Do you find the whole process of finding the right plan and jumping through all the bureaucratic hoops frustrating?
I’m currently in this boat.</span>

<span>Introduction My app, Numerology, has been in the Apple app store for over 17 years. During that time, it and its variations (lite version, Mac version) have been downloaded over 188,000 times, and made almost $150,000 in profit.

It’s ran on just about every Apple iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Before the App Store, it even ran on classic macOS machines.
It’s been through technology changes such as moving from Think C to Objective-C to Swift; the Think Class Library to UIKit to SwiftUI; classic to modern macOS, 68K chips to PowerPC chips to Intel chips and then to Apple Silicon.</span>

<span class=item__date>Jan 16, 2025</span>
<span>In my last job, I was on a platform team. One of the responsibilities of a platform team is to support all the other software development teams in an organization by writing libraries and tools that can be used by the other teams.
One of the libraries the platform team provided was a library that managed feature flags for the iOS app that our company produced. The primary function of the library was to get the current value of a given feature flag.</span>

<span class=item__date>Jul 05, 2024</span>
<span>Testing has grown to be a very important part of software development. When I first started my career, I didn’t hear about writing tests until a few years in. Then we started writing tests for all our libraries. When I first got into Cocoa development, testing was not a part of the culture. That slowly changed, and now it is an important part of development on Apple platforms.
In many ways we are still catching up to other development cultures where testing has been much more ingrained in the culture, such as the web development world.</span>

<span class=item__date>Jun 20, 2024</span>
<span>On June 6th, I flew out to Pittsburgh to see the Pirates play the Dodgers for the final stop in my lifetime goal to see a home game for every MLB team. What’s interesting is that the very first game I ever saw was the Dodgers vs. the Pirates in Los Angeles in 1976. So a fitting end. I didn’t plan it the way, it just happened. It took 48 years of being in the right city at the right time (due to business trips, vacations, etc.</span>

<span class=item__date>May 11, 2024</span>
<span>In comments to my last article on The Composable Architecture readers have asked about examples of how I think an app should be written. In the article, I did mention my previous posts, which have examples for Clean Swift and MVVM, but those were written for UIKit. SwiftUI didn’t exist at the time.
So, this article will talk about what I think is a great example of architecture for a SwiftUI app.</span>

<span class=item__date>Apr 26, 2024</span>
<span>Introduction I recently finished a 3 year stint with a company that uses the Composable Architecture (TCA) from PointFree. I wanted to write about my experiences with TCA and some of the problems I see with it.
I think Brandon Williams and Stephen Cellis, the creators of TCA, are absolutely brilliant, and what they have managed to pull off with the creation of TCA is amazing. However, It’s just the two of them, and nobody, or no thing, is perfect.</span>
