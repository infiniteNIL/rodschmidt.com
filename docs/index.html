</span><span class=item__date>Dec 22, 2025
</span><span><p>I am a fan of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29>Lisp</a>. I was first attracted to it because it was the original language of artificial intelligence because of its ability to manipulate symbols and its own code. I spent a whole year using Lisp in a series of courses on artificial intelligence in college. I became quite adept at using it and quite enjoyed using it as well.</p><h2 id=my-obsession>My Obsession</h2><p>Lately, I’ve become kind of obsessed with being able to use Lisp in my iOS apps. I want to put a Lisp interpreter in my app and program my business logic in Lisp. Every once in an awhile I get the urge to figure it out, try, and fail. This keeps happening.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/s7-scheme/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/numerology-history-6/>Numerology: 17 Years in the App Store (Part 6)</a>

First $300, then $200, sometimes as low as $100. Sometimes it would spurt back up to $300.</p><p>This continued until fairly recently. In 2024, I noticed a competitor that always showed up first in the App Store search results when you searched for ‘numerology’. I decided to look into them a little more. According to Sensor Tower, their app was making over $5,000/month on the Apple App Store. They had an Android app as well, and it was making $5,000/month as well.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/numerology-history-6/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/numerology-history-5/>Numerology: 17 Years in the App Store (Part 5)</a>

</span><span><p>In my last job, I was on a platform team. One of the responsibilities of a platform team is to support all the other software development teams in an organization by writing libraries and tools that can be used by the other teams.</p><p>One of the libraries the platform team provided was a library that managed feature flags for the iOS app that our company produced. The primary function of the library was to get the current value of a given feature flag. If you’re not familiar with feature flags see <a href=https://launchdarkly.com/blog/what-are-feature-flags/>Feature Flags 101: Use Cases, Benefits, and Best Practices</a>. Basically, they are used to turn off and on features of an application at runtime.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/feature-flags-case-study/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/thoughts-on-testing/>Thoughts on Testing</a>
</span><span class=item__date>Jul 05, 2024
</span><span><p>Testing has grown to be a very important part of software development. When I first started my career, I didn’t hear about writing tests until a few years in. Then we started writing tests for all our libraries. When I first got into Cocoa development, testing was not a part of the culture. That slowly changed, and now it is an important part of development on Apple platforms.</p><p>In many ways we are still catching up to other development cultures where testing has been much more ingrained in the culture, such as the web development world. Their tools just seem to be more mature, but it is also easier to test something that is based on a stateless protocol like HTTP.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/thoughts-on-testing/>➦</a></div></div><ul class=pagination><li class=page-item><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/ class=page-link aria-label=First><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a href class=page-link aria-label=Previous><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a class=page-link href=https://rodschmidt.com/>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=https://rodschmidt.com/page/2/>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=https://rodschmidt.com/page/3/>3</a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><span aria-hidden=true>&nbsp;&mldr;&nbsp;</span></li><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=https://rodschmidt.com/page/6/>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/page/2/ class=page-link aria-label=Next><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/page/6/ class=page-link aria-label=Last><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></div></body></html>
