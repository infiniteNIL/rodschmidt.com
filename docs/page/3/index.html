</span><span><p>In the last <a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/model-view-controller-problems-and-solutions/>post</a>, I talked about MVC, its problems, and how it could be done right. Various architectures have emerged to try to address the deficiencies of MVC. Before I talk about the Clean architecture, I&rsquo;d like to talk about some of them.</p><h2 id=alternative-architectures-to-mvc>Alternative Architectures to MVC</h2><p>Up front, I don’t have a lot of experience with these, but I have studied them and I believe they are a step in the right direction. They all introduce another object to take over some of the responsibilities from the controller, but I don’t think they go far enough because the new object typically has too many responsibilities as well and tends to grow just as the controller in MVC does. They do spread the load though, reducing the issues with MVC and increasing testability.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/moving-towards-the-clean-architecture-for-apple-development/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/model-view-controller-problems-and-solutions/>Model View Controller: Problems and Solutions</a>

</span><span><p><em>Model View Controller</em> or <em>MVC</em> is the application architecture used by default for applications on all Apple platforms. Most of the tools, frameworks, and docs from Apple all talk about it and support it. In MVC, objects are assigned 1 of 3 roles:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Model</strong> - objects that encapsulate and manage the data the application works with (this includes persistence). The data typically represents things in the real world like an employee, hardware part, or a picture that is being drawn. More abstract things can also be part of a model such as a hiring process. When data in the model changes it notifies a controller object, typically via delegation or notifications. Model objects should have no knowledge of the user interface and be reusable in other applications in similar problem domains or on other devices.</p></span>... <a class=read-more-symbol href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/model-view-controller-problems-and-solutions/>➦</a></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/5-ways-to-avoid-force-unwrapping/>5 Ways to Avoid Force Unwrapping</a>

Every source file that accesses the app delegate’s MOC would need that import, which would bring in everything else the app delegate uses.

</span><span><p>In my previous <a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/what-are-the-downsides-to-putting-the-core-data-moc-in-the-app-delegate/>post</a>, I gave some reasons why putting the Core Data MOC in your app delegate was a bad idea. Those reasons were:</p><ol><li>The app delegate is managing the Core Data stack. Classes should only have one responsibility. The app delegate is already responsible for managing application lifecycle. It shouldn’t be managing the Core Data stack as well.</li><li>You are completely dependent on Core Data and using it as your persistence method for your app. What if you decide to switch to Realm or something?</li><li>Any code you write that uses <code>myManagedObjectContext</code> will be dependent on the App Delegate.</li><li>Any tests you write will be dependent on the App Delegate and Core Data and will be hard to test and slow as a result.</li></ol><p>In the previous <a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/what-are-the-downsides-to-putting-the-core-data-moc-in-the-app-delegate/>post</a>, we talked about how putting the Core Data MOC in your app delegate makes your app dependent on Core Data as your persistence mechanism and makes it hard to use something else. In this post, I’d like to talk about <strong>reason #1: That your app delegate is already responsible for managing the application life cycle and it shouldn’t be responsible for the Core Data stack as well</strong>.

The IOKit API is an old Core Foundation library and even has some old <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model>COM</a> style APIs. There’s some complex macros as well that do not even get transferred to Swift, so you have to find their definition and and put them in a Swift constant or function.
