I left early, about 8am. I wanted to get an early start so I could check out Mission Viejo and then make a good start on my way home. I lived in Mission Viejo for about 10 years. I went to grade school and junior high school there. I really loved the California life style there. The athletic programs were excellent and I was a well known baseball and soccer player in the community.</span>

In the morning, Ron and Roe took me out to breakfast in downtown LA at a cozy little old restaurant surrounded by skyscrapers. It was good standard fare. After we got back I packed up and headed south to San Diego.
About halfway between LA and San Diego is a town called Mission Viejo. I had lived there for 10 years before I moved to Utah. My plan was to stop there and revisit my childhood.</span>

After spending the night in Palo Alto, I started down the freeway to LA the next morning. Nothing really to write about here. Just your standard freeway drive. However, the traffic was horrible. Seemed like every half-hour or so you ran into stop and go traffic. Not fun. Just this alone made me think I didn&rsquo;t want to live here.
My friend, Laury&rsquo;s sister and brother-in-law live in LA.</span>

<span class=item__date>Jun 15, 2002</span>
<span>I&rsquo;ve tried everything when it comes to trying to meet women. I&rsquo;ve tried dating services, personal ads, phone ads, internet dating, blind dates, being set up by friends, going to bars, and even asking out complete strangers. The most I&rsquo;ve ended up with is a relationship that lasts for 6 months, but feels more like 2. I&rsquo;ve told myself that I&rsquo;ve tried everything.
I was thinking about this today when suddenly I had a Zen moment.</span>

Today started off with a great drive through more evergreen lined roads. That lasted till about midday. Then the road turned into a more freeway like drive with the golden hills of central California as the view, Eventually, I passed through the Golden Gate Bridge (horrible traffic) and settled in Palo Alto.</span></div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://rodschmidt.com/posts/west-coast-tour-oregon-coast/>West Coast Tour - Oregon Coast</a></span>

Today started off well. Found my way to the PCH, flipped the top down, and right away I was on a single lane road with no one in front of or behind me. That didn&rsquo;t last long however. Kept going through towns where you have to slow down for the traffic. But every so often you hit a stretch of road and its just you and the road.</span>

Took my time getting started and probably left Portland around 10am. Dez lent me some audio books (Thanks Dez) and I leisurely drove to Seattle arriving at about 3pm. Had the top down most of the way, but had to put it up about an hour outside of Seattle because I was starting to get sunburned. Its 90 degrees in Seattle today!
Safeco Field
Caught a shuttle from the hotel to the ballpark and arrived about 5:30 pm.</span>

The whole purpose of the west coast tour is too see the west coast baseball teams I haven&rsquo;t seen yet (Seattle and San Diego) and to drive my Miata down the coast. So to that end I got up early and left at 5am and drove 12 hours with a few stops for lunch and rest.
On the way to Portland
bug plastered Miata
Arrived at my friend Dez&rsquo;s place at about 4pm PST.</span>

On Wednesday I caught a flight to Atlanta (thanks to my sister&rsquo;s buddy pass) and arrived at about 2:30 PM EST. Caught the MARTA (Atlanta equivalent of TRAX) right from the airport to downtown. My hotel was only a couple of blocks from my stop. One thing I notice is the humidity. To me, it actually felt good. Keeps your skin moist and when it&rsquo;s hot you actually sweat.</span>
