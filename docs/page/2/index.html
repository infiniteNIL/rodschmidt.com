        In part 2, I talked about why putting the MOC in the app delegate is a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.
In part 1, I talked about why putting the MOC in your app delegate makes you dependent on Core Data for your application’s persistence.
Today I like to talk about the 3rd reason I gave in part 1, which is:
 Any code you write that uses myManagedObjectContext will be dependent on the App Delegate.

        In my previous post, I gave some reasons why putting the Core Data MOC in your app delegate was a bad idea. Those reasons were:
 The app delegate is managing the Core Data stack. Classes should only have one responsibility. The app delegate is already responsible for managing application lifecycle. It shouldn’t be managing the Core Data stack as well. You are completely dependent on Core Data and using it as your persistence method for your app.

        In a previous post, I wrote about controlling my OWI robot arm with Elixir. Well, I decided to port that to Swift!
In that post, there’s a link to some code that does it in Objective-C with IOKit. I first tried to just do a straight port and use IOKit in Swift. That didn’t work to well. The IOKit API is an old Core Foundation library and even has some old COM style APIs.

        Lots of companies have constant problems testing their iOS apps. Here are some ways to fix or ease them.
1. Don’t Make Developers Run or Write UI Tests UI tests are black box tests and test the app from the perspective of the user. Your developers are the worst choice to test the app from this viewpoint and you need a fresh set of eyes for those tests. The QA engineer’s job is to test the app from the user’s viewpoint.

        I saw this question on the iOSProgramming topic in reddit:
 I&rsquo;ve seen a number of different ways to access the NSManagedObjectContext when working with Core Data, but I was wondering if there are any downsides to the way I&rsquo;ve been doing it. Basically, I stick a computed variable in the AppDelegate, and grab it when I need it&hellip; Please let me know if you see any flaws&hellip; If not, feel free to use it!

        My robot hobby is picking up steam. After going through the Python examples that came with the GoPiGo, I got inspired by some embedded Erlang videos on YouTube and decided to see if I could control the GoPiGo with Elixir. After watching Elixir Sips, I learned of a project called Elixir/Ale, an Elixir library for embedded programming. With Elixir/Ale, you can talk to the GPIO ports on the Raspberry Pi and some common hardware bus protocols: I2C and SPI.

        I’ve been getting into robots lately. For a long time I was searching for the perfect robot kit to use with my Arduino. Then I decided I’d rather use my Raspberry Pi to control my robots so I could use better programming languages like Clojure, Elixir, Scala, Ruby, etc. So I was looking around for the perfect Raspberry Pi robot kit.
For Christmas, my parents gave me the OWI Robotic Arm Edge.

        The Problem Last week, I had to implement sticky footers in a table view. Sticky footers are where the footer comes at the end of all the table contents, but if the contents are such that the scrollable content height of the table view is less than the height of the view, the footer will still appear at the bottom of the view.

        You&rsquo;ve probably noticed that my blog has changed again. I&rsquo;ve moved back to Wordpress from Octopress. I could never find a plugin for Octopress that did image captions right. I spent way too much time on it and just decided to use something that just worked. I looked at a lot of static blogging engines and they all had their issues.
With Wordpress, I have to use the web based editor, but it works and their is a lot of plugins and support behind it.

        A while back I wrote a blog post and entered it in a contest for App: The Human Story. I came in second, and for that I was awarded a custom app token from Matic. It finally came last week and here it is:
