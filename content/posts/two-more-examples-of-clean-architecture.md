I recently found two more examples of Clean Architecture. The first one is called CosyHome and is an example iOS application for a home heating system developed using [Clean Architecture](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and developed with [Acceptance Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test%E2%80%93driven_development) (ATDD) using [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org). Fitnesse is something I'd like to dive more into and could be a future post. Let me know if you're interested. You can find CosyHome [here](https://github.com/paulstringer/CosyHome). The other example is CleanNote that applies Clean Architecture to an iOS and Mac application. You can find that one [here](https://github.com/dcutting/CleanNote).
