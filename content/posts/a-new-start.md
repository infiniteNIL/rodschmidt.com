If you haven't noticed, my weblog has a new design and new content. I have switched from WordPress to Octopress and have used a new theme. So far, I like it. It's nice to be able to use Markdown instead of some slow web tool to write my posts. My old blog was mostly political commentary and I've decided to remove that. Some of my most popular posts were the posts about my sabbatical that I took in the summer of 2002. Those, I have preserved and ported over to the new system. I enjoyed reading them myself. You can find them in the [Sabbatical](/category/sabbatical/) category. Going forward, I would like to focus more on technical articles. Occasionally, I might talk about some personal interests. I will avoid political commentary. There's enough of that on the web and it really doesn't accomplish anything or help anyone. Rod
