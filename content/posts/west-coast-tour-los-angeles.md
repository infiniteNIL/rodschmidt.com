**Saturday, June 15th, 2002**

After spending the night in Palo Alto, I started down the freeway to LA the next morning. Nothing really to write about here. Just your standard freeway drive. However, the traffic was horrible. Seemed like every half-hour or so you ran into stop and go traffic. Not fun. Just this alone made me think I didn't want to live here.

My friend, Laury's sister and brother-in-law live in LA. Laury let them know I was coming so I called them and got directions to their place. Arrived about 5pm. Ron and Roe were very nice and gracious to let me stay in their place. I convinced Ron to come to game with me (Yea, I didn't have to drive) and we headed off to the Dodger game.

Dodger Stadium was the first stadium and baseball game I ever went to. I was about 7 years old. I hadn't been there since despite the fact that the Dodgers were and are my favorite team. It was great the see the beautiful stadium overlooking the palm trees.

The game was fun too. The Dodgers played the Anaheim Angels. My first freeway series! The Dodgers jumped to an early lead with back-to-back home runs. A couple of innings later, Shawn Green hit his second homer of the night. A week earlier he had hit 4 home runs in one game. Unfortunately, that didn't happen again. He was intentionally walked and flied out his other times at bat. In the end it was the Dodgers 10-5.

P.S. Stay tuned for pictures. I had to get them developed because I forgot my camera at the game.
