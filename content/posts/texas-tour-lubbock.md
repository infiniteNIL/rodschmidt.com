**Saturday, August 3rd** 

From Albuquerque, I decided to go half way to Austin, and stay the night with a recent friend of the family and her family. I had just met her when I had been up to Montana this summer and she had offered to let me stay with her and her family when I went to Texas. In the directions she gave me to get to her house she mentioned that there was a steel house that I couldn't miss. She was right. However, she didn't mention that it was their house that her husband had been building for 27 years!

It is probably the most interesting house I have ever seen. From some angles it looks like a spaceship. From the outside it looks like the villian's submersible fortess in the _Spy Who Loved Me_. Inside, it has flowing stairs, curved walls and big windows. A very cool house.

For dinner we went to an Italian restaurant, very similar to Macaroni Grill. After dinner, we saw a video. It was _The Sheltering Sky_ with John Malkovich and Debra Winger. By the time that was over, it was 2 in the morning. And then we went for a walk! 

I had planned to leave right away in the morning, but I was having a lot of fun and Patricia was pretty persuasive. Once I woke up, we went for another walk. I ended leaving for Austin about 11 am. All in all it was a lot of fun and Patricia and her husband, Robert are an interesting couple and easy to get along with. Patrica is very outgoing and Robert and I seem to have a similiar philosophy about life and our respective crafts (he's an architect).
