## Problem
Are you self-employed? Are you unemployed? Do you have to purchase your own health insurance?

Are you generally healthy, and rarely need a doctor? Are you into alternative health care, which health insurance never covers anyway?

Do you find “Affordable” health care, unaffordable like you see on healthcare.gov?

Do you find the whole process of finding the right plan and jumping through all the bureaucratic hoops frustrating?

I’m currently in this boat. The least expensive plan on the marketplace for me is over $700. That would make it the 2nd highest item on my monthly expense list. Right now, my monthly income is less than that. I simply can’t afford it.


## Solution
I’m pretty healthy, and I’m into alternative healthcare such as functional medicine. I don’t believe in covering up symptoms with drugs.

Conventional health insurance rarely covers what I believe is the best way to address my health issues.

I went to healthcare.gov and started an application. Multiple times. Each time, they would say the state of Utah would need to look at my application to see if I qualify for medicare. The state would come back and say I didn't qualify, but I still couldn't get through to see the plans. I had to lie on my application to get to the plans.

As I said above, the cheapest plan was over $700 a month. I didn't want to play that.

[CrowdHealth](https://www.joincrowdhealth.com/?referral_code=A3VIIQ) is the solution I found. It’s crowd sharing for health expenses. You pay a monthly membership of $55. On top of that, you will be asked to contribute to someone else’s needs each month. My first month, I was asked for $40, but it could be a few hundred.  The max you would pay in one month is around $350. This is cheaper than the COBRA continuation plan I was using.

Good luck to you.
