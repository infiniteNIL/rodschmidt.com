I finally went to another baseball game in my goal to see every MLB team at their home stadium.
This time I went to St. Louis to see the Cardinals. I call this my penultimate stadium because just
Pittsburgh is left after this one. More on that later.

Here's the box score:

Click [here](https://www.mlb.com/gameday/brewers-vs-cardinals/2023/09/20/716495/final) to see a
rundown of the game.


The Cardinals lost to the Milwaukee Brewers, 8-2. I picked my seats just so I would have
good view of the great Nolan Arenado playing 3rd base, but he didn't play, taking the night off. Bummer.

I quite enjoyed St. Louis. I went to a couple of BBQ places, one where I had the best brisket sandwich
I've ever had. The meat was nice and juicy with a mustard BBQ sauce. I bought some BBQ sauce, but
I was later mugged by the TSA at the airport and had to give it up.

I also went to [The St. Louis Aquarium](https://www.stlouisaquarium.com) and
[The National Blues Museum](https://www.nationalbluesmuseum.org), and, of course,
[The Gateway Arch](https://www.gatewayarch.com), which you can also see in the background of the
photo of the stadium.

It turns out the St. Louis and Pittsburgh might not be my last 2 stadiums. With the Oakland A's
moving to Las Vegas, MLB want to expand the league by 2 more teams. Among the potential cities are
my own Salt Lake City, Nashville, Oakland, San Antonio, and even Mexico City, Mexico. I think it's
very unlikely that SLC will be selected.
