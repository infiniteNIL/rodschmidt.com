**Tuesday, June 18, 2002** 

The trip home was uneventful. Got back about 2 pm. Once back, I felt strangely alone and isolated. On the road, I hadn't felt like this at all, despite the fact that I had been alone most of the time. 

But, it also nice to be back in my nice house, with my own bed. Later that night I played softball on DSW's team. DSW (Dahlin, Smith, and White), was the company I worked before I took my sabbatical.
